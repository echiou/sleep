Hi, I'm [Ethan Chiou](www.echiou.com) and this is my personal reference guide for coffee. I'm a fan of manual brewing coffee, and every time I would make a cup I would find myself looking up a reference guide and remembering how I would change that recipe to my liking. So, in the interest of documenting my process, I've made an easily editable reference guide for myself (and whomever else would like to know how I like my coffee) - it will include the steps I follow for the various brewing methods I've tried and links to online guides I follow or reference, in case I need to remember where I got that information.
