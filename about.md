## About This Game

Hi, I'm [Ethan Chiou](http://www.echiou.com), and this is my final project for Psych133: The Psychology of Sleep at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/). I wanted to make something that could concisely demonstrate to users the effect that sleep deprivation can cause, even just for one day when studying for an exam. That ended up manifesting itself in the form of a game, where the decisions the player makes affects what happens the next day.

This game was heavily influenced by [this beautiful game](https://herringblue.github.io/content/train/index.html).
