A combination of [Blue Bottle](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/aeropress) and [Stumptown](https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/aeropress)'s Aeropress guides, this is a recipe I developed for Amy to use an Aeropress with minimal equipment (before she finally decided on a Clever Coffee Dripper).

### Equipment

Aeropress

Grinder

### Prep

Heat up about 0.5 liters of water.

Wet Aeropress filter with hot water.

![Aeropress Grind Size][Aeropress Minimal Grind]

Grind 17 grams of coffee (a slightly rounded Aeropress scoop) slightly finer than sea salt.

### Brew

![Aeropress Load Coffee][Aeropress Minimal Load]

Assemble and place Aeropress upside-down (flared side up) and pour the coffee in.

Pour water just off the boil into Aeropress, filling it around halfway between the 1 and the top within ~10 seconds, and lightly spin the chamber to saturate all the grounds.

![Aeropress Stir][Aeropress Minimal Stir]

Stir the slurry using the Aeropress paddle to agitate.

Wait about a minute, and then stir 10 times.

Place the filter on the Aeropress, and then flip it quickly onto a mug or server. Press evenly until you hear a hissing sound.

![Aeropress Press][Aeropress Minimal Press]

Make sure you clean the Aeropress quickly after, to reduce the pressure & wear on the rubber seal.

Enjoy!
