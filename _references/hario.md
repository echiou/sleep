*TODO: When there are more reference pages, change header link to dropdown menu*

Inspired by [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1wxcs4/reference_hario_mini_mill_grinder_click_settings/), I figured a Hario Mini Mill reference chart would be useful for quick reference. People in the post make a good point that it probably only works best as a starting point, and that new beans probably require dialing in, based on the beans age & tasting notes.
